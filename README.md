This repository contains implementations of the 13 fundamental data structures in C. These structures are crucial for a variety of algorithms and real-world applications. Each directory contains an implementation of a specific data structure along with an example of how to use it. Below is a brief description of each data structure.

## 2D Array

### Description:

A **2D array** is a collection of elements organized in rows and columns. It can be seen as an array of arrays and is commonly used to represent matrices or tables.

### Files:

- `2D_array.h`: Header file with the structure and functions for a 2D array.
- `Example_1.c`: Example usage of the 2D array.

---

## AST Tree

### Description:

An **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** is a tree representation of the structure of code. Each node in the AST represents a construct from the source code (e.g., expressions, variables, operations). It is widely used in compilers and interpreters for code analysis.

### Files:

- `ast_tree.h`: Header file for the AST tree structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example showing how to create and manipulate an AST.

---

## Array

### Description:

An **array** is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored at contiguous memory locations. It is one of the most basic data structures and is used for storing lists of items.

### Files:

- `Array.h`: Header file defining the array structure and related functions.
- `Example_1.c`: Example usage of arrays.

---

## Double Linked List

### Description:

A **doubly linked list** is a type of linked list where each node contains a reference to both the next and previous node. This structure allows traversal in both directions.

### Files:

- `doubly_linked_list.h`: Header file defining the doubly linked list structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example usage of the doubly linked list.

---

## Graph

### Description:

A **graph** is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. It is used to represent relationships between objects, such as social networks, routing algorithms, etc.

### Files:

- `graph.h`: Header file defining the graph structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example demonstrating graph traversal.

---

## HashMap

### Description:

A **HashMap** (or hash table) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index (hash) into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### Files:

- `HashMap.h`: Header file defining the hash map structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example showing how to use a hash map.

---

## HashSet

### Description:

A **HashSet** is a set data structure implemented using a hash map. It allows for efficient membership checking, insertion, and deletion of unique items.

### Files:

- `HashSet.h`: Header file for the hash set structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example demonstrating operations on a hash set.

---

## Linked List

### Description:

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node. It is efficient for inserting or deleting elements at arbitrary positions.

### Files:

- `linked_list.h`: Header file defining the linked list structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example usage of a linked list.

---

## Max Heap

### Description:

A **Max Heap** is a binary tree-based data structure where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. It is commonly used in priority queues.

### Files:

- `Max_Heap.h`: Header file defining the max heap structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example showing how to use a max heap.

---

## Queue

### Description:

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. It is used in scenarios like task scheduling, managing requests, etc.

### Files:

- `queue.h`: Header file defining the queue structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example demonstrating queue operations.

---

## Stack

### Description:

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. It is used in scenarios such as expression evaluation, backtracking, and function call management.

### Files:

- `stack.h`: Header file for the stack structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example usage of a stack.

---

## Tree

### Description:

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure where each node has a value and zero or more children. It is widely used in file systems, databases, and parsing expressions.

### Files:

- `tree.h`: Header file defining the tree structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example usage of tree operations.

---

## Trie

### Description:

A **Trie** (or prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve strings. It is often used in autocomplete systems and dictionary implementations.

### Files:

- `trie.h`: Header file defining the trie structure.
- `Example_1.c`: Example usage of a trie.
