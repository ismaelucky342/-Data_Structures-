# Data_Structures
This repository is dedicated to learning the various data structures used in the world of programming and computing, providing a complete and well-organized collection of implementations and practical examples of the most important data structures. These structures are fundamental for the development of efficient algorithms and data management in any software application.


### Content
#### U1 Introduction to Data Structures:
This module covers the basics and importance of data structures in programming. It introduces how data structures optimize the storage and organization of data to improve algorithm efficiency.

#### U2 Stacks and Queues:
This module explores two fundamental data structures. Stacks operate under the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, while queues follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. Their applications, such as task management and operation reversal, are discussed.

#### U3 Lists:
This module studies different types of lists, such as linked lists (singly, doubly, and circularly linked). It covers basic operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, and discusses their use in scenarios where the size of the data collection is dynamic.

#### U4 Searching and Sorting Algorithms:
This module covers essential algorithms for sorting and searching data in collections, such as bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, binary search, and linear search. These algorithms are fundamental for data manipulation and retrieval.

#### U5 Heaps:
This module delves into heaps, a special tree-based data structure used mainly for implementing priority queues. It discusses heap properties, heap operations (insertion, deletion), and the heap sort algorithm.

#### U6 Trees:
This module covers tree structures, including binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and red-black trees. It focuses on tree traversal methods and how trees are used in hierarchical data representation and efficient searching.

#### U7 Graphs:
This module introduces graph theory and graph data structures, including directed and undirected graphs. It covers graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and fundamental algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

#### U8 Shortest Path Algorithms:
This module focuses on algorithms used to find the shortest paths in graphs, such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm. These algorithms are crucial in network routing and optimization problems.

#### U9 Hash Tables:
This module explores hash tables, a data structure that maps keys to values for efficient data retrieval. It covers hash functions, collision resolution techniques (like chaining and open addressing), and the practical applications of hash tables.

#### U10 Choosing Data Structures for Different Problems:
This final module teaches how to select the appropriate data structure for various problems based on factors like time complexity, space complexity, and the specific requirements of the task at hand. It emphasizes the trade-offs involved in these choices.
